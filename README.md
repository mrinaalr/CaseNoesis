# CaseLinker

**CaseLinker** is a project designed to group and visualize **statistical** and **contextual** information from cases involving crimes against children and child sexual exploitation & abuse (CSEA).

## Live Demo

**Try the latest version online:** [https://caselinker.up.railway.app/](https://caselinker.up.railway.app/)

The live release includes all features and a processed case corpus from publicly available ICAC / NCMEC / DOJ / State Attorneys General press materials. The corpus holds **7,426 cases** across **56** ingestion sources. Live counts and per-source coverage are on the in-app **Sources** page. These reports summarize investigations, arrests, and prosecutions, redacted for public release. No PII was processed; all data was already in the public domain. No installation required — just open the link in your browser.

## Motivation

This project was motivated by challenges I encountered with understanding child exploitation cases, including:

- **Fragmented data sources**: Cases are scattered across numerous organizations, states, and agencies
- **Cross-case analysis**: Identifying patterns, similarities, and connections between cases becomes challenging without a unified system, even when cases share common characteristics such as abuse patterns, platforms, or perpetrator demographics
- **Limitations in trend analysis**: Analyzing the evolution of child exploitation, the mediums in which it occurs, and recurring case topics
- **Emotional impact**: The challenge of repeatedly reading and processing highly disturbing case material

CaseLinker aims to address these challenges by serving as a tool for case analysis, enabling researchers, law enforcement, and advocacy organizations to better understand the landscape of child exploitation.

## Emphasis

- **Feature extraction**: Robust extraction of information from cases and explainability for clusters and analysis
- **Clustering and linking**: Cases based on shared characteristics such as victim context, platforms used, and law enforcement actions
- **Visualization**: With particular attention to tasteful presentation of case content, and pattern analysis across investigations

## System Architecture

CaseLinker follows a modular, layered architecture:

1. **Ingestion Layer**: Handles PDF data sources with text extraction and validation
2. **Processing Layer**: Extracts features, assigns comparison values, and fills case schema
3. **Storage Layer**: PostgreSQL (production) / SQLite (local development) - Database-agnostic implementation
4. **Clustering & Analysis Layer**: Case comparison, similarity detection, automated grouping, triage, and insights generation
5. **Visualization Layer**: Interactive web-based dashboards with D3.js visualizations (main charts, Search tree, analysis views)

## Usage

### ⚠️ Important: Data Content and Warning

**CaseLinker processes publicly available case reports and related records for research, analytical, and investigative workflow purposes.**

**While all source materials are drawn from public reports, content involves descriptions of child exploitation, abuse, or other disturbing criminal case details that may be difficult to read.**

**Please proceed with awareness of the sensitive nature of the material and use the project responsibly for research, academic, or authorized analytical purposes.**


## Entry Points

1. **`src/main.py`** - **CLI Tool for Processing PDFs**
   - Processes PDF files to extract and store cases in the database
   - Run this when you want to add new cases from PDF files
   - Extracts text, identifies sources, splits cases, extracts features, and stores them
   - Pre-computes clusters after storing new cases

2. **`run/main.py`** - **Main application**
   - Starts the web server that serves the visualization interface and API
   - Run this to access the web interface and visualizations
   - Uses pre-computes clusters on startup for fast performance
   - Provides REST API endpoints for case data, analysis, and statistics

3. **`caselinker_mcp/server.py`** — **MCP server for agent and LLM analysis**
   - Exposes **34 tools**: corpus search, triage, Q1 platform evidence, on-demand `case2cac` cohort graphs, Turtle export (`export_case_graph_ttl`), and graph traversal
   - Read-only; wraps the existing REST API; no database mutation
   - Reach out for private mcp.json keys and review `caselinker_mcp/README.md` & `caselinker_mcp/tool_registry.md` for setup, auth and the full tool catalog

**Typical use case:**
1. First, process PDFs with `src/main.py` to populate the database
2. Then, start the web server with `run/main.py` to view and analyze cases
3. Optionally, connect an MCP client (Cursor, Claude Desktop, or any MCP-compatible host) via **stdio**, **SSE**, or **Streamable HTTP**

## Process Your Own PDF Files

**The local database starts empty.** To populate it with cases, you need to process PDF files you want to ingest.

### Processing PDFs to Populate Database

Once you have PDF files, process them using the CLI tool:

**Single PDF:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 src/main.py "path/to/your/file.pdf"
```

**Multiple PDFs:**
```bash
python3 src/main.py "2011 Cases and Arrests – AZICAC.ORG.pdf" "2020 Reports" "2024-media-coverage-cybertipline-success-stories.pdf" 
```

**All PDFs under the repo** (e.g. after a fresh DB wipe):
```bash
./scripts/run/ingest_all_pdfs.sh

# Skip NCMEC/DOJ on first pass if you want state feeds first:

./scripts/run/ingest_all_pdfs.sh --no-aggregate
```

The system will:
1. Extract text from each PDF
2. Identify organization name from filename (AZICAC, NCMEC, etc.)
3. Batch cases, extract features, assign case IDs
4. Store all cases in the local SQLite database
5. Pre-compute clusters for fast visualization

## Using the Visualizations

Access the visualizations via the [live demo](https://caselinker.up.railway.app/visualization) or locally at http://localhost:8000/visualization.

1. **Case Group**: Displays cases matching specific groups (infant, very young, abuse, possession, online) 
2. **Severity Indicators**: Bar chart with color gradient showing severity levels (multiple perpetrators, hands-on abuse, production, etc.). Click bars to view cases with highlighted severity text.
3. **Case Visualization**: Enter a Case ID (with autocomplete suggestions) to view comprehensive case details. The visualization displays structured information cards for platforms, severity indicators, case topics, investigation details, demographics, evidence volume, and prosecution outcomes with key information highlighted.
4. **Previous Perpetrator**: Pie chart showing registered sex offenders vs. non-registered. Click slices to view cases with highlighted perpetrator status.
5. **Environment**: Bar chart showing distribution of platforms and environments used (Facebook, online, chat, etc.). Click bars to view cases with highlighted platform text.
6. **Organizations Involved**: Horizontal bar chart showing law enforcement agencies involved (AZICAC, FBI, Phoenix Police, etc.). Click bars to view cases with highlighted agency names.

## Using Search

Access Search via the [live demo](https://caselinker.up.railway.app/search) or locally at http://localhost:8000/search

Search provides a **facet decision tree** over the stored case corpus: the server builds a deterministic partition tree from structured facets (not a precomputed file on disk). The view uses **D3.js** (SVG) to render cohort nodes and edges. You can limit tree depth, **prune** which partition dimensions apply and optionally filter allowed values per facet (extracted feature), then **click any node** (branch or leaf) to list **case IDs** in that cohort for use elsewhere (e.g. single-case visualization, manual cross-case analysis). Small cohorts (fewer than three cases) have IDs gated behind a demo access key. See `src/Storage Layer/facet_tree.py` and `/api/facet-tree` for the partition order and semantics.


## Using Advanced Case Analysis and Triage

Navigate to [live demo](https://caselinker.up.railway.app/analysis) or run server locally and navigate to http://localhost:8000/analysis.


1. **Tag-Based Analysis (Run Advanced Analysis)**:
   - Select one or more tags from categories: Case Topics, Severity Indicators, Platforms & Environments, Investigation Types, Perpetrator Relationships, Perpetrator Status
   - Click "Run Advanced Analysis" to find all cases matching ALL selected tags (intersection logic)
   - View matching cases with highlighted text showing where tags were found in the raw case data
   - See case counts for each selected tag

2. **Automated Analysis (Run Automated Analysis)**:
   - Click "Run Automated Analysis" to run the full automated analysis pipeline
   - **Case Groups**: View cases grouped by similarity (platforms, demographics, topics, severity, investigation)
   - **Top Priority Cases**: See cases sorted by priority score (normalized to 5-10 scale) based on:
     - Severity indicators (35%): infant, rape, very_young, physical_abuse
     - Victim count (30%): Higher scores for multiple victims
      - Case type (25%): production, hands_on, possession, online_only
     - Severity phrases (15%): dangerous, stated, told, continue, attacked, out_of_control, attracted
     - Evidence volume (10%): images, videos, storage size
     - Registered sex offender (10%): Repeat offender status
   - **Automated Insights**: View insights about most common platforms, severity distribution, and case topics
   - **Patterns Detected**: See patterns like repeat offenders, relationship patterns, and investigation focus
   - **Top Keywords**: View most frequent keywords extracted from case text
   - **Expandable Details**: Click any box to view raw case data with highlighted priority indicators and detailed explanations of why the analysis prioritized/grouped the case

Access Triage via the [live demo](https://caselinker.up.railway.app/triage) or locally at http://localhost:8000/triage. Current implementation uses **rule-based** priority tiers, **ML Classification for triage** (random forest or decision tree trained on features from the database with labels derived from deterministic rules), optionally constrained by the same facet-dimension filtering used in Search, and supports **paste-in live triage** that scores text in memory without writing to the database. For the full triage documentation (rules, bundle paths, APIs, live paste), see **`triage.md`** in the repo root.

## Phase 2: Patterns ([local](http://localhost:8000/patterns) · [live](https://caselinker.up.railway.app/patterns)) is an ongoing stage of research for cross-case pattern analysis ontop of the corpus.

### Section A — The Research Questions

Three questions drive Phase 2; each builds on the last. Findings pages: [`/patterns/questions/q01`](https://caselinker.up.railway.app/patterns/questions/q01) (Q1), [`q02`](https://caselinker.up.railway.app/patterns/questions/q02) (Q2), [`q03`](https://caselinker.up.railway.app/patterns/questions/q03) (Q3).

| Question | Focus | Why it matters |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Q1 — Platform harm** | What is the platform and what capabilities does it have? How has it been misused in practice, and what surfaces, vectors, and avenues for exploitation does it expose? What specifically about this medium makes it usable for exploitation? Can those properties be  generalized into a framework for stress-testing future platforms? | Press releases and online harms research often name platforms but rarely explain *what about the medium* enabled the offense. Affordance-level analysis turns platform mentions and documented crimes into a transferable framework. Evidence: `ontology/q1/` ([`q1_evidence.json`](ontology/q1/q1_evidence.json)) |
| **Q2 — Exploitation lifecycle** | What does offending and enforcement look like at scale across offense subsets (familial abuse, grooming, sextortion, production, possession, etc.)? What platforms, methods, and patterns recur within each? | Most ICAC research works in hashing, aggregate counts, or single-case narratives. The lifecycle view, stratified by subset, shows how offending and enforcement unfold across thousands of cases. Evidence: `ontology/q2/` ([`q2_lifecycle.json`](ontology/q2/q2_lifecycle.json), [`q2_evidence.py`](ontology/q2/q2_evidence.py)). |
| **Q3 — Kill-chain interventions** | Given Q1 and Q2, where can technology, investigation, or enforcement intervene with the most leverage? | Platform mapping and lifecycle analysis exist to answer the operational question: where disruption is most plausible (detection, reporting, warrant execution, prevention). Evidence: `ontology/q3/` ([`q3_interventions.json`](ontology/q3/q3_interventions.json), [`q3_evidence.py`](ontology/q3/q3_evidence.py)). |

Rebuild evidence tables locally:

```bash
python3 ontology/q1/build_candidates.py && python3 ontology/q1/q1_evidence.py
python3 ontology/q2/build_candidates.py && python3 ontology/q2/q2_evidence.py
python3 ontology/q3/build_candidates.py && python3 ontology/q3/q3_evidence.py
```

### Section B — The Method: Ontology Pipeline

To answer Q1–Q3 at corpus scale, enforcement narratives cannot stay only in relational tables and regex-derived tags. They must be expressed in a **structured, graph-queryable** form so patterns can be queried, validated, and compared across cases. CaseLinker already extracts consistent features from each narrative; the **ontology pipeline** maps those features into a standard investigation vocabulary and builds a validated knowledge graph as the mechanism for cross-case analysis.

**What is an ontology :** The [CAC Ontology](https://github.com/Project-VIC-International/CAC-Ontology) (Crimes Against Children Ontology) is a formal vocabulary developed to model the entities of a child-exploitation investigation as typed, related objects: platforms, victims, offenders, investigations, and outcomes. CAC is shepherded by [Project VIC International](https://www.projectvic.org/) and is built on the Linux Foundation's [Cyber Domain Ontology](https://cyberdomainontology.org/) stack ([UCO](https://unifiedcyberontology.org/) and [CASE](https://caseontology.org/)). CaseLinker case data is being aligned to this vocabulary so graphs can be shared, validated, and queried with the same tools used in forensic and intelligence workflows.

**How CaseLinker uses ontologies :** A deterministic mapping layer translates each case's extracted features into CAC entities and relationships, emits per-case RDF graphs, validates them, and merges conformant graphs into a queryable knowledge graph.

**Pipeline flow** :

1. **CaseLinker case features** — already extracted (platforms, topics, investigation signals, prosecution outcomes).
2. **Mapping layer** — deterministic translation to CAC entities and relationships (`ontology/graph_generate.py`).
3. **RDF emission** — per-case graphs as Turtle and JSON-LD under `ontology/graph_output/`.
4. **SHACL validation** — only conformant graphs enter the merged corpus.
5. **SPARQL-queryable corpus** — merged validated graphs become the substrate for Q1–Q3 analyses.

Agents can also build cohort graphs on demand via MCP (`case2cac` → `graph_summarize` → `export_case_graph_ttl`).

## Case Schema & Feature Extraction

Each case includes structured features extracted from case narratives:

### **Regex extraction**

- **Perpetrator**: Age(s), registered sex offender status, gender when stated; flags for multi-defendant operations
- **Victim**: Age(s), age ranges, count when explicitly stated in victim-clause phrasing, gender after validation
- **Relationship**: Kin and role labels (father, mother, parent, sibling, teacher, coach, stranger, etc.); unknown when not stated
- **Platforms**: Named apps and surfaces — social, messaging, gaming, file hosting, livestreaming, early-era chat, Gen AI tools when cited — plus generic online, chat, or social media when no product matches
- **Technology signals** (stored separately from the platform list): investigation tooling (PhotoDNA, hash matching, CyberTipline language), anonymization (Tor, dark web, cryptocurrency), P2P clients
- **Prosecution**: Charge phrases with counts, booking stage (arrest through sentenced), jail mentions, sentence durations
- **Evidence volume**: Image, video, storage, and message counts when quantified in text
- **Investigation**: Non-exclusive types — proactive, reactive, online, undercover, CyberTipline-origin, or unknown; agencies from pattern matching plus NER supplements
- **Prior record**: Registered status and age at prior arrest when stated

### **Pattern-based classification**

- **Case topics**: production, possession, distribution, trafficking, csam, ai_csam, sextortion, hands_on vs online_only, family vs stranger, international, multi_state
- **Severity indicators**: infant, very_young, under_12, sexual_abuse; multiple_perpetrators when several offender ages are extracted
- **Severity phrases**: dangerous, stated, told, continue, attacked, out_of_control, attracted — used in priority scoring

### **ML enrichment**
When the ML stack is enabled, NER adds organizations, locations, dates, and ages, merged with regex output. A victim-age gate drops decoy and headline ages. Semantic sentence scoring stores concept scores on each case; grooming may add a severity tag, and strong possession or AI-generation language may reinforce case topics. Most concept scores are kept for analysis; only selected ones are merged in with main fields.

### **Clustering & storage**
- **Comparison values**: Normalized vectors (platforms, demographics, investigation, evidence, topics, severity, date) for similarity and pre-computed clusters
- **Agency pathways**: Federal vs state/local splits where inferable from narrative context
- **Preserved data**: Raw narrative, source organization, source URL when present, source publication date from formatted PDFs, timestamps

## API Endpoints

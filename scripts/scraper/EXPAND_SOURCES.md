# ICAC / CAC source expansion queue

**Pipeline** (you provide the search/listing URL; agent runs the rest):

1. **Harvest** — `fetch_source_urls.py`, site API, or Jina (SPA sites). Query must be **`child sexual`** (not bare `child`).
2. **Dedupe** — drop URLs already in the merged `*_ICAC_All.pdf` (and obvious noise: grants, bills, DEI, index pages).
3. **Novelty gate** — `python3 scripts/scraper/check_expand_novelty.py --batch-pdf … --baseline *.pre_expand.bak --new-urls-file …` (must PASS before append). Uses **raw PDF URLs** (authoritative) plus body fingerprint vs baseline.
4. **Scrape** — `scrape_pdf.py --url-file …` → `batch.pdf`
5. **Append** — merge into repo-root `*_ICAC_All.pdf` (backup `*.pre_expand.bak` first).
6. **Re-check** — `check_expand_novelty.py --pdf … --baseline *.pre_expand.bak` (no double-dip in merged file).
7. **CAC verify (required)** — every batched case in the final merged PDF must pass `verify_cac.py`. **Print and save ALL failures** (not just a sample). Do not ingest until failures are removed or justified.
8. **Recommend** — next source from the table below.

### Step 7 — CAC verify on final PDF (all failures)

After append, run (repo root):

```bash
python3 scripts/verify/verify_cac.py \
  --pdf SCAG_ICAC_All.pdf \
  --source "SCAG ICAC" \
  --all-failures \
  --default-fail-csv
```

- **`--all-failures`** — prints **every** non-CAC case to the terminal in a numbered block (`case_id`, URL, preview).
- **`--default-fail-csv`** — writes a full machine-readable list to  
  `scripts/scraper/state/<pdf_stem>_cac_failures.csv` (one row per failure).
- Exit code **1** if any case fails → treat as blocking until you review the CSV.
- Optional: `--json scripts/scraper/state/<stem>_cac_verify.json` for automation.

Same pattern for each expanded source, e.g. Kentucky:

```bash
python3 scripts/verify/verify_cac.py \
  --pdf KYSP_ICAC_All.pdf \
  --source "KY SP" \
  --all-failures \
  --default-fail-csv
```

**What to do with failures:** grants, bills, fugitive manhunts, election/DEI press, etc. → delete those pages from the merged PDF (or exclude URL and re-merge). Borderline CAC wording may pass on manual read even if regex misses — note in CSV, don’t auto-delete.

**Already expanded (re-verify anytime):**

| PDF | Source key | Failures CSV (after `--default-fail-csv`) |
|-----|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `SCAG_ICAC_All.pdf` | `SCAG ICAC` | `scripts/scraper/state/scag_icac_all_cac_failures.csv` |
| `KYSP_ICAC_All.pdf` | `KY SP` | `scripts/scraper/state/kysp_icac_all_cac_failures.csv` |

## DOJ (justice.gov) — API source, not a URL-harvest source

Different mechanism from every row above: `justice.gov` is Akamai-gated for direct scraping (see `PRESS_RELEASE_SCRAPING.md`), so it is not harvested with `fetch_source_urls.py` and does not go through the novelty-gate/CAC-verify steps 1–7 above as written (those assume a scraped-URL batch). Instead:

| Source key | Endpoint | Entry point | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------------|-------|
| DOJ press releases | `https://www.justice.gov/api/v1/press_releases.json` (docs: `.../developer/api-documentation/api_v1`) | `scrape_noesis.py` → `scrape_pdf.py --noesis-file` | Title-substring search + exact URL-slug match, not a listing crawl. No API key. 4 req/s limit. |

**Recon (counts only, no records pulled) as of 2026-07-18** — `parameters[title]` substring search, single term vs. phrasing variants, to scope wording sensitivity before any batch pull:

| Category | Term | Count |
|---|---|---:|
| Elder fraud | `"elder fraud"` | 710 |
| | `"elder abuse"` | 175 |
| | `"elderly victims"` | 246 |
| Trafficking | `"trafficking"` (bare) | 20,800 |
| | `"sex trafficking"` | 2,615 |
| | `"human trafficking"` | 485 |
| Racketeering | `"racketeering"` | 2,127 |
| Extortion | `"extortion"` | 962 |
| Child exploitation/CSAM | `"child exploitation"` | 2,547 |
| | `"child pornography"` (legacy statutory term) | 13,997 |
| | `"child sexual abuse material"` (modern term) | 1,123 |

Takeaways: single-term search both **undercounts** (elder fraud: DOJ republishes the same case under "fraud" vs "abuse" wording — confirmed via a literal duplicate case in testing) and **overcounts** (bare `"trafficking"` is mostly drug/arms/wildlife trafficking, not human/sex trafficking — 7x the combined human+sex count). CSAM has the widest single gap: the legacy term outnumbers the modern term ~12x. Any batch pull needs multiple phrasing variants per topic, deduped by API `uuid`, not a single term.

This is reconnaissance only — no batch harvest logic exists yet for the DOJ API (deliberately out of scope until URL-collection volume is scoped; see the one-article pipeline test in `scripts/scraper/PRESS_RELEASE_SCRAPING.md`).

## Next expansion phase: fetch_source_urls.py as a general URL/record discovery system

**Status: planning / scoping only — nothing below is built.** No API integration beyond DOJ exists yet. This section documents the next phase of work, not current capability.

**Standing first step, not a one-off insight.** The DOJ case revealed a pattern that should now be checked for *every* new agency before writing a scraper for it: does a public API already exist? Many .gov sites (especially Drupal-based ones, which a large share of state AG and federal agency sites are) expose one whether or not it's advertised — check `/api/v1/...`, `/jsonapi/...`, search "`[agency] developer API`", and view-source for Drupal meta tags (`Drupal.settings`, `X-Generator: Drupal`, `/jsonapi` links in `<head>`) before assuming a site needs HTML scraping. Finding an API before building a harvester avoids exactly the class of problem `justice.gov` posed (bot-wall-gated HTML with a perfectly good API sitting behind it, unused).

**`fetch_source_urls.py`'s current scope** is HTML-listing-page harvesting only: plain pagination (`--url-template` + `--page-range`), Squarespace's search API (`--squarespace-search-page`), Google Programmable Search / CSE (`--google-cse-search-page`), and `search.usa.gov` (`--usa-search`). All four output the same thing — a deduplicated list of bare URLs to a text file. None of them talk to an agency's own structured data API the way `scrape_noesis.py` now does for DOJ.

**What "beefing it up" means concretely:** extending `fetch_source_urls.py` so that, for a source with a real API, it can emit the same *resolved-record* shape `scrape_noesis.py` already proved out for DOJ — `{title, byline, body, pub_date, agency, source_url}` — instead of just a bare URL list. That resolved-record shape is already a first-class input to `scrape_pdf.py` via `--noesis-file`, so a harvester that speaks a new agency's API directly could hand its output straight to `scrape_pdf.py` without an intermediate scrape step at all, the same way DOJ records skip fetch/extract entirely today. Concretely, this would mean: (1) detecting/declaring which agencies in the expansion queue have a usable API, (2) adding a per-API harvest mode to `fetch_source_urls.py` (or a sibling module) that queries it and normalizes results into the resolved-record shape, and (3) feeding that output into the existing `--noesis-file` path unchanged. No changes to `scrape_pdf.py`'s conversion logic would be needed — that part is already source-agnostic; this is purely about widening what feeds it.

Semantic Concepts (ML)

Goal: Given a case text, identify key severity and investigative
**concepts** semantically (not just via regex) so we can:

- enrich cases with ML extracted features that downstream code can use
  for analysis and false‑positive correction; and
- later build a `semantic_ideas` / concepts table for statistics and
  grouping cases by ideas instead of only regex tags.

Aim to model a much broader set of ICAC / CSAM concepts (production vs
possession, grooming, sextortion, law‑enforcement operations, online
platforms, etc.).
